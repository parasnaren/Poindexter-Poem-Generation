"Your darkness is a symphony
Played in explosions of silence to a crowd that has fallen in love with noise
If they refuse to applaud you
It isn't because your music isn't beautiful 
It is because they have no idea how to love what they don't understand
And that
my darling
is the most horrific flaw in this mixed up world"

sunshine played with
her hair."

weariness
and depression
and troubled sighs
at the end of the
wailing day

in places the
sun never
Touches."

to love.

who loved the waves
but was completely
terrified to
swim."

i just feel impossible.
like life wasn't meant
for me.

we remember
and not just
remember
what we
felt."

i mean absolutely crazy
about what you love

love."

but for Christ's sake
do not sugercoat it.
give me it raw
and gleaming with
truth.

to twirl me around until
i can no longer stand.
i refuse to be drunk
on a soft world.
the world is cruel
my love
you must understand
that
but in that understanding
you must understand this
too
just because it is cruel
does not mean it is not
beautiful."
"she was the kind of woman
who only gave herself away in small doses
leaving men wandering like little children
at all that she was.

of her fading footsteps
each one an exclamation mark
to a sentence the world tragically
instilled in her long ago
""find something beautiful
then
let it go."

thoughts
walking around the earth

understands
the absence
of noise
is beautiful.

you are

what you are
is essential."

"every morning i see a cup of coffee
in front of my sleepy eyes but i am
starting to see things differently
because of you.
now i see beans
once tossed in hands
and broken down in machines
and placed in bags
sent off somewhere
where the tired people gather.
i see that only because your tenderness
has taught me that we must look beyond
the body of everything and into the soul of all."
"the details of anything you love are always what is most thrilling, most poignant, most important. I loved her as she rose from bed and fell back against it again and all she did in-between.
when you love someone you accept them
you become them in a way
and all they
do forms into you. their mannerisms turn
into truth- the way she holds her favorite coffee mug
the way she laughs
the way she smells
the way her lips
curl after certain words. all of the simple things
suddenly become gigantic things and light up the world
before you like a flame thrown into the clouds.
what a breathtaking display. the way
the earth begins to dissolve in your periphery
and a human being replaces it.
no matter what they tell you-
a person is a universe when truly
loved and anything less is not
love at all."
"when the wine is gone
and you remove your tired body from
your steaming bath
come to bed.
do not worry about putting
on your night clothes
naked you'll
come as you know the moon
loves the sight of your bare flesh
through the window.
the sheets are calling your name
my dear.
come as you are.
there is enough love
in me to birth an entirely
new universe and to it
we can run whenever this world
becomes too heavy for our
shaking shoulders."
"i am something new""
you must tell yourself.

end
of a story that will
never be liver again.
i am new earth and
new air and
new words.
i am as fresh as
birth.
i am significant."
"the gate around
heaven was
crowded when we
arrived together.
you looked at me
and giggled
and with whiskey on
your rose breath
you led me to some
place higher.
i always knew you were
beyond them.
i just wasn't sure
how far."
"nestle up with me now and let us
fall in love with the feeling
of our worries spilling into the sheets.
nestle up with me now
let us give birth to seeds of whispering moans
and let those coil with our bones
as we tumble in love with the blooming echo.
nestle up with me now
let us grow old and die delicate in each other's arms
for my god what an exquisite honor it would be
to erode from this crumbling earth
all the while being washed in your
lover's grains

nestle up with me."
"do you want to know how to seduce the night?
this is not a poem about the stars or the moon
because we all know i have overused those terms and i
believe with the abundance of anything brings
with it a deadly exhaustion we all cannot afford.
if you truly want to fuck the night and i mean
fuck it hard and with purpose so that fucking
becomes making love and making love becomes
forever then i suggest you get off your lazy ass and
create art. create it with your soul and your soul
alone and do not be afraid of what
spills out of it. no matter the absurdness or the
darkness or the sadness just let yourself be free."
"it was you and i that night
by the sea
two bottles of wine and
a bowl deep
we kissed and made love
as the moon and waves
talked business."

but for reasons I will never figure out
we have not the slightest clue of what to do with all the love."

I will shed all of this skin down to the very bone beneath it if that's what it will take for you to come to the realization that appearance is not what makes a human beautiful.
I beg of you to not feel guilty for having affection for someone or something others don't support or agree with. Our minds will trick us all but we are damn fools if we think our hearts ever will. Love what you love. Nothing else really matters 
"He told me with heavy breaths, ""The only person I have left in life is my sister, and I just found out she has cancer."" Then with a shrill sigh, lifts his glass to the moon, ""Cheers to god"" as I watched the tears spill from his eyes. "
She was tired of waiting around for someone to tell her she was beautiful; she decided to feel it instead. Can anyone blame her? The cocaine was merely a snowflake calling a young girl to come play. 
Just as if you were to cut open minutes they would bleed seconds in slicing these veins open all that would come spilling out are the grains of you that make up an entire me. 
I admit I was afraid to love. Not just love but to love her. For she was a stunning mystery. She carried things deep inside her that no one has yet to understand and I I was afraid to fail like the others. She was the ocean and i was just a boy who loved the waves but was completely terrified to swim.
I love when my dreams play hard to get. My passion finds it so damn sexy. 
If the words have failed to scream from this ink or flutter from these tired lungs telling them to you now I am; not only are you enough but you are so much more than you think you could ever be. 
We build castles with our fears and sleep in them like kings and queens. 
I will alway hope that you will let simplicity leak itself through your heavy skin. For it is the only thing that can carry such small beauties and still so perfectly spill the most brilliant and stunning light.
Not only did I love her but I could tell the universe loved her too. More than others. She was different. After all I would be a fool not to notice the way the sunshine played with her hair.
Flooded lungs and a heavy heavy heart it'll sink to the bottom of all that you are. That strange beating I found at your waist side left my fingers utterly scared then you stopped their trembling and said you were sorry for you only ever knew how to cry backwards into your own soul. 
Give me all your suffering and I swear it will be carried even if that means the death of sorrow inside you and the birth of sorrow inside me. 
I madly adore the wallflower that grew inside you when you were born and how though I don't deserve the grace it sprouts and dances for me and truly forgets it's love for silence 
I loved her not for the way she danced with my angels but for the way the sound of her name could silence my demons. 
I am yours. I am yours as the stars belong to the sky and I am yours as the rivers belong to the sea. I am yours as your tears belong to your eyes and I am yours as your lungs belong to the pattern in which you breathe
It is ever so beautiful to be strange. To do things differently than others. To see things in a rare light. To me that is such gold to carry.
All I want all I've ever wanted since the bones in me began to grow is to know love and for love too; to know me.
You are worth more than you will ever know And I love you in ways your crumbling heart could never fathom. Come to me in pieces And exist inside me whole.
They say love will not last that it has no happy ending but I say the hell with what they say: let us burn these fears down to the ground and we will dance like children in the ashes.
She was passionate about the rain and I was passionate about the way she loved it. It was that way with everything. It is safe to say that if I didn't have her, there would be no fear in me at all.
I loved her both for the way the air stole the tears from her eyes and the way she smiled slightly because she knew the universe would never give them back. 
His eyes were like clocks that stopped spinning the moment she stared into them. The universe halted. All things began to breathe each others stillness. To her: it was a simple blue eternity.
I'll throw my voice into the stars and maybe the echo of my words will be written for you in the clouds by sunrise. All I an trying to say is: I will love you through the darkness.
Not only did I love her but I could tell the universe loved her too. More than others. She was different. After all I would be a fool not to notice the way the sunshine played with her hair
We know so perfectly how to give birth to the monsters inside us but for reasons I will never figure out we have not the slightest clue of what to do with all the love.
"""Love me slowly,"" she whispered, like the love I had for her, had limits. Like it could run out as easily as a grain of time. I could tell, by the sound of fear in her lungs, that she had a terrible past. The kind that no one talks about, the kind that remains bottled up inside of you, slowly and quietly, killing everything in your bones."
The problem with love these days is that society has taught the human race to stare at people with their eyes rather than their souls.
"""Do you feel that?"" She asked as we watched the stars and moon illuninate the sea before us. “Tell, me you feel it? That longing to not just exist, but to live and to live beautifully? "" I, with a smile filled with so much truth it could move the clouds, said to her: “Of course I feel it. The heart in you, is the heart in me."""
I want her to hold but I am afraid I will miss being alone. My grandmother used to tell me I have the ocean's soul. I want everything and nothing in harmony. I am chaos.
There is always a lovely way to look at things you know? Like the days we spend apart are as beautiful and essential as the spaces between the stars.
Love is the moon and the sun the stars and the sea the e1der couple in the coffee shop smiling after all these broken wonderful years. Love is not our romance as if we were made from wires and screens
He loved her without desperation and needs and wants. With his naked soul he loved her and dreamt of her clothed in white dancing beneath the moonlight as the stars grew jealous of the way she moved.
You know what truly aches all that you are? Having so much inside you and not having the slightest clue of how to pour it out.
This my love is how we will never stray from love and it is quite simple: remember me in the way the sea remembers the shore.
Her eyes carried a certain kind of silence that begged to be understood and I felt as if I was a scientist staring with eager fervent eyes into galaxies that have not yet had the chance to be named.
In a world with so much money we could buy the stars I urge you do not sell your fucking soul.
Her spirit was a bed in which his loneliness could softly rest.
Isn't it crazy that in life the person who brings out the best in you and makes you strong is actually your weakness?
I stood alone beneath the stars and shouted to the heavens at the top of my lungs and what was so beautiful was the way the stars shined when the sky swallowed your name.
Give me music and I will feel your heart give me reality and I will feel your scars.
The saddest thing in the world is when you realize that people will never understand you- I have always held other people's sorrow in my bones until it became my own and my friends think I am crazy.
